#EventHubProcessor
Console app to publish pi data to event hub in Azure.

##details
Reads pi data from a CSV file `data.json` that was generated by the `strange-piwebapi` app. That app was created because of the performance issues we ran into with grabbing data in 'realtime' from piwebapi for streaming into Azure.

The `data.json` file will be on a client machine and not is available in this repo due to filesize considerations.
